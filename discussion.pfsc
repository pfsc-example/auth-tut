# Discussion

This is a simple annotation. It's basically the same as
the one we wrote before, but we're changing it up a little,
so that we can tell it apart.

This annotation can point to <chart:>[a step in a proof]{
    view: Pf.R
}, and to <chart:>[another step]{
    view: Pf.S
}, and thereby offer some discussion or explanation of the proof.
