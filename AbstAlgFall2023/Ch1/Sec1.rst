Okay, this is still not a realistic example, but let's at
least look at how we can point to a proof chart from
a Sphinx page.

There are two forms in which chart widgets can be
written: *role* and *directive*.
Here we write chart widgets in role form.

We can point to :pfsc-chart:`a step in a proof <Pf.R>`
and to :pfsc-chart:`another step <Pf.S>`.
