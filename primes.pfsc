# Key Ideas

In the proof of the infinitude of primes, the key construction is
<doc:>[the number $N$]{
    sel: Pf2.I30,
}.
Having <doc:>[supposed]{
    sel: Pf2.S10
} there were only finitely many primes, we conclude that $N$
must be congruent both <doc:>[to $0$]{
    sel: Pf2.A80
} and <doc:>[to $1$]{
    sel: Pf2.A90
} mod some prime $p$, and this contradiction completes the proof.

Under the *reductio* assumption of the proof, that there are only finitely many
primes, the number $N$ always turns out to be prime. But what happens in the real
world, where there are in fact infinitely many primes?

We'll investigate numbers of the form of $N$, and check whether they're actually
prime or not.

Start by picking a prime number $p$.
